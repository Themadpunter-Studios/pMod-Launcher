https://themadpunter.itch.io/pmod - Itch page

Open up an instance of ShredMod (https://shredmod.github.io/scratch-vm/). Then, load in the TurboWarp Extensions extension PointerLock. Then, load the file.

## Quick Start Guide

The first thing you will want to do in the game is summon an object using Q and the arrow keys to select the object. You can use R+1 to hold a gun or ride a car. You can shoot things with Space, and pick up things with E. Using C creates a camera and using V moves to it. You can freeze objects with R+2, rotate them with R+3, and more. You will also need to reload your gun with T if it runs out of ammunition.
